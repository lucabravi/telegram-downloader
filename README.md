# Telegram downloader

This is a *simple* bot to download telegram files directly to your own server
without needing to keep telegram open or using telegram-cli, this uses Telegram's
MTProto protocol to download files up to 4GB using the [Pyrogram Framework].

created at [My Telegram] website, do this before continue
